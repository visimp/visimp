# `gleam` layer

The `gleam` layer enables support for the Gleam programming language.

## LSP
As of this writing, the Gleam LSP is not available in the Mason registry (see
[this issue](https://github.com/mason-org/mason-registry/pull/5911#issue-2324191120)).
Therefore, a manual installation is necessary. For guidance, please refer to the
instructions on the [Gleam official website](https://gleam.run/language-server/).
