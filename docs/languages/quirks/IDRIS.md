# `idris` layer

The `idris` layer enables support for the Idris programming
language via [idris2-vim](https://github.com/edwinb/idris2-vim). This plugin's
documentation specifies its requirements.

## Bindings

Mappings are available [in the "Interactive Editing Commands" section of idris2-vim](https://github.com/edwinb/idris2-vim?tab=readme-ov-file#interactive-editing-commands).

## Configuration

Any vim **global** variable that [the "Configuration" section of idris2-vim](https://github.com/edwinb/idris2-vim#configuration)
states can be set to configure idris2-vim is also a valid field for this layer's
config, as long as you strip the `idris_` prefix. As Idris does not have a
Language Server on Mason at the moment, `lspconfig` should only be used if `lsp`
is set to the name of a preinstalled executable that can be used as a Language
Server for the language.

## Examples

```lua
-- path/of/your/vim/config/init.lua

require("visimp")({
  coq = {
    indent_if = 3 -- do not use the idris_ prefix
  },
  languages = {
  "idris"
  }
})
```

## Documentation

The full documentation for the plugin is available
[here](https://github.com/edwinb/idris2-vim?tab=readme-ov-file). The plugin was
written by Idris designer [Edwin Brady](https://type-driven.org.uk/edwinb), who
also wrote [a blog post titled "Interactive Idris editing with vim"](https://web.archive.org/web/20170307061942if_/http://edwinb.wordpress.com/2013/10/28/interactive-idris-editing-with-vim/).
